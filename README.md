# rock-paper-scissors
This is a project to implement skills learned thus far to create a game of rock-paper-scissors
The program will choose and return randomly from an array consisting of rock, paper, and scissors
User will be prompted to provide to a function an argument of their choice of rock, paper or scissors and take the computer's choice as the second argument
The function will compare the user's choice against the computer's random choice and print the winner of the round or if there is a tie
If there is a tie, the function will return play again 
Initiate a counter and initialize to zero
If there is a clear winner, print the winner and increment counter by 1 
The game will play for 5 rounds
